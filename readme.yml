title: Watson Discovery News Alerting

description: |
  In this developer journey, we will build a Node.js web application that will
  use the Watson Discovery Service to access Watson Discovery News.

  Watson Discovery News is a default data collection that is associated with
  the Watson Discovery Service. It is a dataset of primarily English language
  news sources that is updated continuously, with approximately 300,000 new
  articles and blogs added daily.

  The focus of this journey is to monitor a product's marketplace life-cycle
  using Watson's Discovery service to intelligently alert when a product's
  stance in the marketplace has changed. Users can recieve periodic email
  alerts about a product or brand and how they're perceived in the News.

  Alert tracking can be set up for the following areas:

  * The product
  * The brand
  * Related products and brands
  * Positive or negative product sentiment
  * Stock prices

  The journey highlights the steps required to build a front-end management
  interface to search Watson News and a back-end service which periodically
  sends alerts out related to customizable queries.

flow:

    The user interacts with the backend server via the app UI. The frontend
    app UI uses React to render search results and can reuse all of the views
    that are used by the backend for server side rendering. The frontend is
    using watson-react-components and is responsive.

  - |
    User input is processed and routed to the backend server, which is
    responsible for server side rendering of the views to be displayed on the
    browser. The backend server is written using express and uses
    express-react-views engine to render views written using React.

  - |
    The backend server stores subscription information in a Cloudant NonSQL
    database for product tracking.

  - |
    The backend server sends user requests to the Watson Discovery Service. It
    acts as a proxy server, forwarding queries from the frontend to the Watson
    Discovery Service API while keeping sensitive API keys concealed from the
    user.

  - |
    The Watson Discovery Service queries the Watson News Collection for
    articles related to the product.

  - |
    The backend server sends periodic updates to email.

    Create Watson Services with IBM Bluemix

    Create the following service:

    * [**Watson
      Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery) -
      name the service `wdna-discovery`
    * [**Cloudant NoSQL
      DB**](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) -
      name the service `wdna-cloudant`
